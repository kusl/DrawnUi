          ### Available Platforms
          - ‚úÖ **Android**: APK included
          - ‚úÖ **Windows**: App included  
          - ‚ö†Ô∏è **iOS/MacCatalyst**: Temporarily disabled due to Xcode version requirements
          
          ### Notes
          iOS and MacCatalyst builds are temporarily disabled because .NET 9 requires Xcode 16.4, 
          but GitHub macOS runners currently have Xcode 15.4. These will be re-enabled when GitHub 
          updates their runners.
